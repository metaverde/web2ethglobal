So,
I broke everything,
starting with `yarn` and moving up the chain.
Apparently I do know enough Linux to be dangerous.
My computer either boots to a Dell error about no bootable device found or the `grub` cli.
*Googly Eyes*

Sigh.

So all I have is vaporware.
My Big Idea is to combine and riff off the Speedrun challenges I've completed 
plus one I haven't and combine the lot of them into a super-dApp.
I'm getting errors on this machine every time I try to spin anything up.
I think it will take a minute to catch him up to 2022.
It's been a year since we've worked together.

So the idea is to have NFTs of a particular artist with various attributes 
qualifying for different white lists, entrance tickets, and income streams,
staking opportunities, still not exactly detailed, and a community token available,
with the parameters of that still needing to be worked out.
Certain exclusive NFTs would be sold with a Harberger Tax in order to fund the project.
This is something we're looking at implementing in Canon at 1Hive.
So I was really excited to be building that direction.
But I broke my computer.
Sigh.

I learned a lot, especially about the mistakes i make when I'm under pressure.
This has been an amazing experience.
I'm confident it will get fixed.

Have a wonderful day.
